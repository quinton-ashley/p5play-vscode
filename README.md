# p5play-vscode

Use this extension to easily create a new p5play project in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open the Command Palette with "command-shift-p" on macOS (or "ctrl-shift-p" on Windows)
2. Start typing "p5play" into the Command Palette
3. Select "p5play: New Project" and press enter
4. Select an empty folder or create a new folder to put your project in.
5. Start coding!

The p5play-template folder contains a basic p5play project that you can run offline.

Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Visual Studio Code extension so you can run your project in a web browser. Click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner of Visual Studio Code to start the server.

If you want to keep p5play updated, install [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [npm](https://nodejs.org). Then in the file menu hover over "Terminal" and select "New Terminal". In your p5play project folder run `bun update` or `npm update` to update p5play to the latest version.
