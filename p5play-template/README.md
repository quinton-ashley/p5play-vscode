# p5play-template

Visit <https://p5play.org> to learn how to use p5play.

This folder contains a basic p5play template to help get you started on your own p5play project! ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ®

## Contents

`favicon.png` - the icon for the web page, which appears on the browser tab
`index.html` - the webpage that runs your sketch.js code
`jsconfig.json` - a file that enables auto-complete and hover documentation for p5play in code editors like Visual Studio Code
`sketch.js` - write your code in the sketch file

## Getting Started

Use the [p5play VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quinton-ashley.p5play-vscode) or [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code to run your project.

## Offline Use

If you want to work on p5play projects offline, then use the offline links in the `index.html` file.

To keep p5play updated for offline use, install [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [npm](https://nodejs.org). Then in the file menu hover over "Terminal" and select "New Terminal". In your p5play project folder run `bun up` or `npm up` to update p5play to the latest version.

## Read me, Read me!

This message will now self-destruct in 5... 4... just kidding! But you can delete the contents of this file and write a README.md file that describes your own project.
